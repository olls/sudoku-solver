This Sudoku solver can solve up to about newspaper medium levels.

Input
-----

To input a Sudoku in to the program, you can either type or paste it
into the text box.

If you have the Sudoku in an `.sdm` file then you can just open the
file in a text editor, and copy the line with the puzzle you want to
solve. Then open the Sudoku solver and paste it in to the text box.

Otherwise if the file is an image, printed or in another format you
will have to type it in to the text box manually. To do this just type
in every letter in the puzzle left-to-right, top-to-bottom, using a
`0` or `.` for a blank cell. The text should be 81 characters long, do
not put any other characters in the puzzle to indicate boxes or new
lines, the program will work this out on its own.

After you enter the Sudoku puzzle into the text box you press `load`
to load the puzzle in to the program. If nothing happens it is either
because the puzzle is broken or it is the same as the one already
loaded.

Solve
-----

To start the solving process, press the `Solve` button. If a message
box opens saying: `Cannot solve puzzle.` It means the solver is not
able to solve the puzzle, either because it is too difficult, or
because it is a broken puzzle.
